Hey, This is the simplest Dice game. It is a VS game in which two players roll a dice and their points get add up.
The player who reaches the 20 POINTS WIN.
IF a dice roll is making the total more than 20 then that turn of that player will be discarded, FOR Example: If a Player 1's Score is 18 and then he gets a 6 in dice roll then this turn of his will be discaded as it is adding the total score more than 20.
